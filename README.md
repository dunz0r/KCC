KCC
===

A joystick/keyboard/display for playing KCC

It uses the Telemachus (https://github.com/richardbunt/Telemachus) plugin
for aquiring data via a python-program which sends it to the microcontroller in charge of the displays.

The other microcontroller emulates a keyboard and joystick via USB with a 6x7 matrix for the keyboard
and two analouge sticks for joysticking.
